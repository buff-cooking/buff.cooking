## Macros per Servings

- KCAL: ~140 kcal
- C: 2.7

## Ingredients

- One Serving of your favourite whey protein (I use ESN or Bulk)
- 1/2 teaspoon Guar Gum (Or Xanthan Gum etc.)
- Hand Full of Ice Cubes
- 50 ~ 100 ml Water (or Nut/Milk - adjust macros accordingly)

## Directions

1. Put ice cubes into blender cup
2. Add Guar Gum
3. Add whey
4. Add 50 ml Water or Nut Milk
5. Blend until smooth ice cream consistency, it's easier when using nut milk. Play around with the amount of liquid you need.

> During blending, make sure that your blender catches the ice cubes. It may take a while, my Nutri Bullet gets warm and struggles a bit once it begins to grow in volume. That's normal.

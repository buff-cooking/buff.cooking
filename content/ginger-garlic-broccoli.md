## Ingredients

- 1 kg Broccoli (fresh best, frozen works too)
- Minced garlic (1 tablespoon)
- Minced ginger (1 tablespoon)
- Soy sauce (Shoyu - low sodium) (1-2 tablespoon)
- Starch (1-2 Teaspoon)

## Directions

1. Cut broccoli into little flourettes (hold the broccoli upside down and cut around the stem with a pairing knife)
2. Fill your pan (or wok) around half inch (1.57cm) with water and bring to a rapid boil.
3. Put broccoli in and steam with lid on for approx. 3 minutes.
4. Drain broccoli and wipe pan dry.
5. One teaspoon of oil and saute garlic and ginger (use sesame seed oil for Asian touch, but neutral or olive oil works well too).
6. Put half a cup (approx 120 ml) of warm water or vegetable stock. Reduce on medium-high heat.
7. Stir in soy sauce, brown sugar or sweetener and lemon juice to your taste.
8. Thicken sauce with starch.
9. Put dry cooked broccoli back in and saute for very short time (you want it nice and crunchy).
